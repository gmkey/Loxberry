REBOOT="Use <b>Reboot</b> to restart your LoxBerry. This may take a while - the appearing progress bar is shown until your LoxBerry is available again."
SHUTDOWN="Use <b>Shutdown</b> to shut down your LoxBerry. To re-enable it, an original Raspberry needs to be plugged off and on."
NOTIFICATIONS="On the top, you may get informed about changes that require a restart of your LoxBerry. LoxBerry itself never triggers an automatic restart, with the exception of important Linux security updates that require a reboot. If a LoxBerry task, like LoxBerry Update, or a plugin installation, is running in the background, you may be prevented to reboot or shutdown. Please wait until the installation has finished."
