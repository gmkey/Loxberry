DHCP="In a usual home network configuration, you should keep <b>DHCP</b> to automatically assign the ip address from your router. In this configuration, hostname resolution (DNS) works automatically. On your router, you may configure a static lease, so LoxBerry always gets the same ip address. A manual ip address setting only should be used if you are familar with network configuration."
