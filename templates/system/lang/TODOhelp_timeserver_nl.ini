INTRO_TEXT1="In the System Time widget you can configure, if LoxBerry should aquire it's system time from internet time servers (NTP server), or from the Loxone Miniserver. It is more accurate to sync LoxBerry with an internet time source. Additionally, you can configure the timezone of your location."
